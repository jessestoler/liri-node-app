# liri-node-app
This is a package that allows you to search for information regarding specific songs on Spotify, information regarding specific movies on Omdb, and your most recent tweets. All of this can be done through the use of simple command line requests:

do-what-it-says = will read a request from a .txt file<br>
movie-this = will return information regarding a movie of your choice<br>
my-tweets = will return information regarding your last 20 tweets<br>
spotify-this-song= will return information regarding a song of your choice<br>

# setup
Run npm init and npm install from the root directory of your project.<br>

You will also need to attain your own keys from both Spotify and Twitter.<br>

Create a .env file in the root, and add your keys in the format below. No quotes around the keys.
